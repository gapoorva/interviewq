# Balancing

Given a string  that contains nothing but the open and close delimiters of parenthesis, (aka the characters `(` and `)`), devise an algorithm to remove extra delimters until the string is balanced. The string may contain other characters besides parenthesis, but this is not necessary. Non-parenthetical characters outside a parenthesis group can be left alone.

Example:

The string `(()()))())` should be changed to `(()()())`.
