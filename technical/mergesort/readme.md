# MergeSort

MergeSort is a well known sorting algorithm that can operate in n*log(n) complexity and N space. MergeSort is best for sorting large volumes of data because the merge step can be performed on disk. MergeSort is also a naturally recursive algorithm.

Implement MergeSort to sort an array of number given the array and the size from least to greatest. Minimize the amount of memory used by your implementation.
