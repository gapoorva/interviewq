# Anagrams

Anagrams are two strings `a`, `b` such that by re-arranging the characters in `a`, you may arrive at string `b`

Solve the following problems related to anagrams:

1. Determine if two strings are anagrams
2. Determine if two strings are anagrams using constant space. You are allowed to modify the strings
3. Determine the minimum number of operations need to "transform" string `a` into string `b` operations are defined as follows:

* Swapping two characters (swap)
* Adding a character to the end of the string (append)
* Removing a character from the end of the string (pop)
